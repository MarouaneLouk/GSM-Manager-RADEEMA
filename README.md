# GSM-Manager-RADEEMA

The GSM Manager project is a management system developed for RADEEMA (Régie Autonome de Distribution d'Eau et d'Électricité de Marrakech) to handle the allocation of telecommunication resources, including voice and data services, to their agents. The system aims to streamline the management of telephony resources, making it easier for administrators to collect monthly or annual reports on telecommunication allocations.

The project was initiated by the Information Systems Department to address the growing need for an efficient tool to manage the company's telephony fleet. The system is designed to meet the primary requirements of users, ensuring effective and user-friendly management of telecommunication resources.
